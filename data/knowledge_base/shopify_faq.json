      "question": "Orders not syncing from Shopify",
      "answer": "If Shopify orders aren't syncing:\n\n1. Check webhook status:\n   - Shopify Admin → Settings → Notifications → Webhooks\n   - Verify webhook is 'Active' (not paused or failed)\n\n2.

      "question": "Inventory synchronization delays",
      "answer": "Inventory sync delays between Shopify and our system:\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Real-time updates via webhooks (< 30 seconds)\n- Backup sync runs every 15 minutes\n\n**If experiencing delays > 5 minutes:**\n\n1. Check webhook health:\n   - Settings → Notifications → Webhooks → 'Inventory updates'\n   - Status should be 'Active'\n\n2. Verify product/variant IDs:\n   - Our system uses Shopify variant IDs\n   - Ensure products aren't archived or deleted\n\n3. Multi-location stores:\n   - Specify which location's inventory to track\n   - Default: primary location only\n\n4. Temporary workaround:\n   - Manual sync available in dashboard\n   - Click 'Force Inventory Sync' (updates within 2 minutes)\n\nNote: Bulk inventory changes (> 100 items) may take up to 10 minutes to fully propagate."

    "api_rate_limits": {
      "question": "Shopify API rate limit errors",
      "answer": "Shopify API rate limits:\n\n**Limits:**\n- REST API: 2 requests/second (burst: 40 requests)\n- GraphQL: Based on calculated query cost (max 1000 points)\n\n**If hitting rate limits:**\n\n1. Our system implements automatic retry with exponential backoff\n2. Non-critical operations are queued and processed during off-peak hours\n3. Priority operations (order sync) bypass queue\n\n**Shopify Plus customers:**\n- Higher limits available (up to 4 req/sec)\n- Contact us to enable Plus tier settings\n\n**Action needed from you:**\n- None - rate limiting is handled automatically\n- Delays during high-volume periods (< 5 min) are normal\n- If errors persist > 30 minutes, escalate to technical support\n\nMonitor your API usage: Shopify Admin → Apps → [Our App] → API usage dashboard"
